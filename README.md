:rocket:  Hello everyone! I'm excited to introduce DeFRaG Manager - a tool that will make every defrager's life easier.

**Why now?**  
I could have spent another year polishing the perfect release, but I decided: it's better to give you a working tool right now and develop it together with you. Yes, there are still tons of features planned, but the core functionality is already stable (it survived testing with 12,000 maps!).

**What can it do?**  
✔ Instant search across all maps in pk3 files (yes, even if there are thousands!)  
✔ Favorites — save your favorite maps with one click  
✔ Your Records — display your personal best demos in both physics modes  
✔ Launch maps directly from the manager (with physics selection)  
✔ Demo Viewer — watch top demos with one click on the time  
✔ Random 10 Maps — perfect for those seeking variety (great for beginners!)  

**Why is this needed?** I was frustrated by the following:  
- The built-in map list in the engine doesn't support more than 1600 maps and is inconvenient.  
- It's hard to remember what you played yesterday or where your best demos are.  
- You can't quickly find a map in a huge collection.  
This motivated me to create a program that simplifies life and is convenient, simple, and visually pleasing.

**⚙ How to use?**  
1. Drop `DeFRaG-Manager.exe` into your Quake 3 root folder (DeFRaG must be installed).  
2. Change your nickname in the settings to your df name (so records load correctly).  
3. Enjoy!

**Want a feature?**  
Write on Discord, GitHub, or Telegram (@Qz3rK) — I'll definitely consider all suggestions and try to add all your wishes in the next release!
